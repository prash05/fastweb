                            <p class="blog"> On some day of July 2062 near county side of Azamgarh up kissed a burning meteoroid which rather went unnoticed because of the incessant rain, rumming cloud and thunder. Locals seeing meteoroid far more different than the usual depiction in the magazine and internet reported it to the press, police, zamindar, thekadar and whom not.</p><p class="blog">
                                Before the strike, Naina was working on the plastic sheet and the wax coating of our playing hut. Just in the matter of second that thing dug ‘maybe 7 feet’ into our land that was toiled last evening for planting paddy crop. It created a slope in the feild and water from all the surrounding rushed into it as if gold were gone free. I slid down into the crater to check what on earth can be so reckless and violent. On reaching down, the only thing that I remember is of strange vibration and my vomiting. Quickly I rushed back towards Naina, and the next thing that people told me regarding that event was I woke up after 18 hours of complete oblivion. When I woke up that place was fenced with red straps calling “POLICE”.</p><p class="blog">
                                Now I realise that I was the first lost human to the immortals of the galaxy. A day after I woke up everyone in the region saw the commandoes live taking on 8 lives creatures which were almost like us. The ‘go’ was quite easy as the beasts seemed to have given up before the end of the tackle. It was broadcasted later in cuts. It was celebrated deep throughout the country as a victory. Still, only I and eight others knew that the war has just begun.</p><p class="blog">
                                A day later things started to get weird as I was able to think and satisfy logic more than anyone and ever. It was no too late when I realised that my head was giving more pain, and the rest of my body was going senseless. I was high to the extent that I  was able to provide theory on alternate realities,  dimensions, galaxies formation and even what has infested me. Those were celestial bodies which were sophisticated and intelligent of the highest order. To make themselves immortals –ended up being a form of a parasite whose host was-creature with some material body depending on the compatibility. In the case of the human male were more of choice than female. I tried to delve deep, but things turned dim slowly.</p><p class="blog">
                                Next day when I got conscious, sat with coffee on the table and explored deep to conclude on the severe facts that I will be me for another maybe 8 days more. My brain will lose all control over my body. Perhaps after that, all the neurons and dendrons that have started growing will gain full access over me.</p><p class="blog">
                                I learned later that evening, the creatures were quite organised and that each of them had a uniquely assigned task. The one in my head or just in me was some sort of command or report junction </p><p class="blog"> 
                                Question -why was I infested when a female is less compatible as host?</p><p class="blog">
                                The answer that I could investigate was during the landing, or perhaps lousy landing the host of the immortals were severely injured and almost immobile. So, for safety concerns, it considered me as an option. (after the predators got the human body, they realised that humans were unaware of their presence. Moreover, the human had no idea of their existence on earth or preferably anywhere in the space.</p><p class="blog">
                                However, the worst part now, because I can peek into them and my physique is changing so I have become a potential threat. As a result, the rest eight of the immortals are coming to kill me and find a new host for the parasite. (technically it is not a parasite though as it is benefiting from me as host but not through nutrient supply as it is immortal)  inside me, also they are being helped by subconscious me.</p><p class="blog">
                                The next thing which I discovered almost shattered me and why not when you are a mere girl who has never been to market alone ever. You realise that 8 people are coming for you who were earlier black cat commando in the Indian Army. If I do not move, they may reach to me at the end of 2nd day, that is enough to make you shit go parallelly between your legs without you being informed.</p><p class="blog">
                                On further digging, I got to know that the shit inside me cannot leave me anyway like that because that will make it vulnerable to being exposed. Also, the mental capacity which has increased of mine will remain unaltered. Remaining the only solution to kill me and then adopt some male body. That afternoon I saw me hurting myself. However, because of partial control, I could not save my left leg from one blow that almost left it motionless. The other immortals were approaching fast, and if I did not move or escape, then I would be dead by next afternoon. And so I went into the creature to look into it fears, hours and hours passed on. Still, there was no sign of any incident, event, object or person that instilled fear into these creatures.  But, hours did not go in vain as I was able to get the composition of few minerals or per se rare minerals which could instead capture the immortals ultimately making them paralysed. It was no difficult after that to realise that it is found in the root of some fancy kind of tree in the Himalayan jungle of Nepal, thanks to google and my newly attained power of thought and analysis. But it was painful to acknowledge that my legs and physical body had almost lost the physical contact with the mind.</p><p class="blog">
                                I stole around 10000 rupees from my parent’s secret trunk box, which I do not have any idea what they were to them. Quickly left the place to revive my self and would not count as an exaggeration  but entire humanity as well. Well, I should indeed tell you about the hypnotising skill and the one to look into anyone brain more because that thing is getting my nerve and neuron denser. So my mind can comprehend and analyse more stuff at the same time. I took the bus to Nepal only after I had a neck and plaster all over my neck, hands and legs. I had an idea that the creature inside me will try to hurt me possible by making me immobile and helpless. So that I am not able to reach that place before the other immortal got better hold of me. And that’s why I did plasters. When I was on the bus, it was then I realised that all my finger was soft and unresponsive as hell. By evening I had reached a cliff from where I was able to locate vast landmass of greenery. But, because of the sudden convulsion, I just slipped from there going through the mosses, herb, bushes and yeah lot of rocks that hit my organ equally. I woke up and found that legs were fractured badly head swollen up, but it was near to the morning, i.e. 6th day that I discovered that my head was swollen, big but lighter than usual. Then something weird struck my eyes “the roots” of the tree on which I swooned, was glowing with a sparkle in the sunshine. It was not very late when I realised that the roots absorbed them and restricted any further movement of the immortal.</p><p class="blog"> 
                                Now things began to get complicated, the remaining of 8 of them knew that they lost their junction. Hence, they are no more connected and therefore, they are in danger too. Their frustration was high as they hurried through the forest lanes. I had a minimal sum of time to lay a trap and get more ways to fix them into the roots at the same time I had to find the solution for broken legs, cracked ribs, swollen head and arms.</p><p class="blog">
                                Now the only solution that remains to me was self-sacrifice. I planned to again occupy the predator in me to call the rest of them and make them jump off the cliff.</p><p class="blog">
                                Off course, it was a success, but days were hell over for the human body, which was groaning and starving and probably mind bursting. Yah! They all got captured, but in the long run, I believe they won as they were there only till no one axed those trees as I too breathed my last in the jungle.</p>
